"""
A dummy integration for inkBoard. Mainly meant to show how to build one (And so I can remember how to myself)

A minimal integration requires a manifest.json file, as well as an __init__.py file with the `setup` or `async_setup` functions.
Optional are `start`/`async_start` and `async_run`.

##Integrations are imported after the config has been read out.
##The recommended way to access the config object, however, is to import core from inkBoard. This module gets all the important objects assigned.

##If the integration should be runnable on the designer, ensure that any platform specific imports are not done in the init.
##These can optionally be imported in any of the functions defined in here, provided the module has a designer hook and overwrites any functions that would pose problems.
